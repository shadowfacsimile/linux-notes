# To show all the network connections
ip link show

# To bring up wlp2s0
sudo ip link set dev wlp2s0 up

// For ethernet to work NetworkManager should be up
systemctl enable NetworkManager
systemctl start NetworkManager

// For wireless to work NetworkManager should be down
systemctl disable NetworkManager
systemctl stop NetworkManager

# wpa_supplicant auth for wifi
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp2s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant_wlp2s0.conf

// PSK can be added by using the wpa_passphrase utility and appending the output to the conf file

# wpa_cli
sudo wpa_cli

// Make sure the wifi function key is working

# To bring up dhcpcd
sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
sudo systemctl start dhcpcd

// Some files I've changed
   - /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
   - /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/90-disable-randomization.conf
   - /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/broadcom_wl.conf

# Now the steps I follow to bring up wifi
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp2s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant_wlp2s0.conf
sudo wpa_cli
scan
[if it fails, make sure wifi is on by using function keys]

# To enable wifi during boot
sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlp2s0.service
sudo systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlp2s0.service
reboot


# Troubleshooting when an kernel update (?) screwed my wifi and the wireless shows up as "UNCLAIMED"

sudo lshw -C network  // shows only the network hardware
sudo pacman -Syu broadcom-wl-dkms
sudo dkms remove broadcom-wl/6.30.223.271 --all
sudo dkms add broadcom-wl/6.30.223.271
sudo dkms build broadocom-wl/6.30.223.271
-- started giving a build error, so I removed all broadcom-wl-dkms and installed broadcom-wl instead

sudo pacman -Rns broadcom-wl-dkms
yay -Rns broadcom-wl-dkms
sudo pacman -Sy broadcom-wl

-- now it works!


To connect to any wireless
--------------------------
1. sudo wpa_cli + scan + scan_results [if you want to check the available ssid]
2. sudo wpa_passphrase SSID 'passphrase' >> /etc/wpa_suppicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp2s0.conf [you may have to run as root]
3. remove the passphrase from /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp2s0.conf and retain only the encoded PSK if you want
4. Reboot & Done!
