# To bring up wlp2s0
sudo ip link set dev wlp2s0 up

// For ethernet to work NetworkManager should be up
systemctl enable NetworkManager
systemctl start NetworkManager

// For wireless to work NetworkManager should be down
systemctl disable NetworkManager
systemctl stop NetworkManager

# wpa_supplicant auth for wifi
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp2s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant_wlp2s0.conf

// PSK can be added by using the wpa_passphrase utility and appending the output to the conf file

# wpa_cli
sudo wpa_cli

// Make sure the wifi function key is working

# To bring up dhcpcd
sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
sudo systemctl start dhcpcd

// Some files I've changed
   - /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
   - /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/90-disable-randomization.conf
   - /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/broadcom_wl.conf

# Now the steps I follow to bring up wifi
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp2s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant_wlp2s0.conf
sudo wpa_cli
scan
[if it fails, make sure wifi is on by using function keys]
